## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository or download the zip file.

3. The gallery uses a CSS file (`tic.css`) and a JavaScript file (`script.js`) for styling and functionality.

## Usage

1. Add images to the gallery by creating new `<img>` elements inside the `.gallery` container.
2. Each image should have a unique `id` attribute and a `data-lightbox` attribute with the image's URL.
3. Clicking on an image will open the lightbox with the corresponding image.

## Customization

* To change the gallery's layout, modify the CSS styles in `tic.css`.
* To change the lightbox's behavior, modify the JavaScript code in `script.js`.
* To add more images, simply add new `<img>` elements to the `.gallery` container.
